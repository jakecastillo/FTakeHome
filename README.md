# Team Compatibility
Objective: Take in a JSON object with team members and applicants and find a way to see if applicants are compatible with team members.


Approach: Bottom-up! build a framework that takes in the important information and returns strong feedback. Decided to use Python since I have some background in Python with machine learning, but I decided that since it is a language that is useful for data processing, I could use this assignmnet to brush up on old skills.

# How to see code
Code is located in FTakeHome.ipynb, but if you'd like to compile it yourself the tools to compile will be located below.
The .ipynb file might take long to load. If it fails please refresh.

# How to compile (although Jupyter Notebook FTakeHome.ipynb comes pre compiled)
Jupyter Notebook is a Python tool that allows you to step your code and from a presentation standpoint allows people who are looking at it a better sense into what went into each step of the process.


[link to download Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/install)


When using this program make sure the supplementary files are in the same folder as the .ipynb (Jupyter Notebook file type)


Open .ipynb and everything should be good to go!
Step through the process by pressing 'play' (located at the top right of the screen) on the cells and watch live compilation.
